## OpenvCloud Functional Tests

Functional testing of OpenvCloud is documented [here](/docs/functional/functional.md), where it is pickup into the public [G8 Testing Guide](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gig/g8-testing-guide).

Please only put **internal** documentation on this page.

There are two types of functional tests, for each of them there is a subdirectory:
- [Tests designed to run on a physical compute node](./compute_node_hosted)
- [Tests designed to run on ovc_master](./ovc_master_hosted)
