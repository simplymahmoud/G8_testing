## Functional Testing

The functional testing section was created to validate an OpenvCloud environment from a functional perspective.  

In this section of the repository we have a subdirectory for each of the following components:
- [ItsYou.online](./Itsyouonline)
- [JumpScale](./Jumpscale)
- [OpenvCloud](./Openvcloud)

Currently only the functional tests for OpenvCloud have been implemented.

The documentation as picked up in the public [G8 Testing Guide](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gig/g8-testing-guide/details) is in the [docs](/docs) directory.

Please only add here **internal** documentation, all other (public) documentation should be added into the [docs](/docs) directory.
