# Parameters required for VM
# RAM and cpu are coupled together,
# please choose between these values [RAM, vcpu] = [512,1] or [1024,1] or [4096,2] or [2048,2] or [8192,4] or [16384,8]

#Boot Disk size (in GB), please choose between these values [10, 20, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000] -- default = 100G

# Parameters required for FIO
# Block size
bs:4k
#IO depth:is the number of I/O units to keep in flight against the file.
iodepth: 1
#Direct IO: If direct_io = 1, use non-buffered I/O. Default:0
direct_io:0
#rwmixwrite: is the Percentage of a mixed workload that should be writes. If rwmixwrite = 70
#then rwmixread will be equal 30 by default

# Type of I/O pattern -- what you will enter will be the same for all VMs (enter:
# 'write' for sequential write or 'randwrite' for random write
# 'read' for sequential read or 'randread' for random read
# 'rw' for mixed sequential reads and writes or 'randrw' for mixed random reads and writes
# if you enter nothing then half of the vms will be write and the other half will be randwrite
