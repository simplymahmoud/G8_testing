## Performance Testing

The performance testing section was created to validate an OpenvCloud environment from a performance perspective.

In this section of the repository we have a Testsuite directory with the scripts running the actual performance tests:
 
- [1_FIO_VMS](./Testsuite/1_fio_vms)
- [2_Unixbench2_test](./Testsuite/2_Unixbench2_test)
- [3_FIO_blktap](./Testsuite/3_fio_blktap) (internal)
- [10_FIO_testing](./Testsuite/10_fio_alba) (internal)


The documentation as picked up in the public [G8 Testing Guide](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gig/g8-testing-guide/details) is in the [docs](/docs) directory.

Please only add here **internal** documentation, all other (public) documentation should be added into the [docs](/docs) directory.
