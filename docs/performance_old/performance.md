## Performance Testing (OLD)

The original performance tests, as documented here, required access to the physical compute nodes of your environment.

Following performance tests are available:

* [UnixBench Test](2_Unixbench2_test/2_Unixbench2_test.md)
* [FIO Test](1_FIO_testing/1_FIO_testing.md)

The new performance tests don't require access to the physical compute nodes anymore, and are documented [here](../performance/performance.md).
