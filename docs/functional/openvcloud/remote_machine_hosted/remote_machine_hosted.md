## Functional Tests Hosted on any Remote Machine

Three types of automated functional tests are available for OpenvCloud:

- Tests that run on **ovc_master**, discussed [elsewhere in this guide](../ovc_master_hosted/ovc_master_hosted.md)
- Tests that run on a physical **compute node**, discussed [elsewhere in this guide](../compute_node_hosted/compute_node_hosted.md)
- Tests that can run on any **remote machine**, discussed here below

Currently there is only one test suite available that can run from any remote machine: [OpenvCloud Portals Functional Tests](portal/portal.md)
