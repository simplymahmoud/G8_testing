## G8 Testing

This repository was created to validate an OpenvCloud environment from both a functional and performance perspective.  

It contains both the internal and public documentation, as well as the actual test suites with the test scripts that perform the tests.

All public documentation as picked up in the [G8 Testing Guide](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gig/g8-testing-guide/details) is in the [docs](/docs/) directory.

From here you will want to check out following subdirectories:

- [functional_testing](/functional_testing), documented [here](/docs/functional/functional.md)
- [demolition_testing](/demolition_testing), documented [here](/docs/demolition/demolition.md)
- [performance_testing](/performance_testing), documented [here](/docs/performance/performance.md)
